**API calls - Promises, Async and Await**
JavaScript and HTML

Using promises to make an API call that gets information about a Pokemon, printing the name, weight and abilities.
Promises help to make asynchronous operations, like retrieving data from an API. Async/await avoids nested callbacks and await 
ensures that the function pauses execution until the Promise is resolved, 
as the next opertion depends on the result of the previous one.
